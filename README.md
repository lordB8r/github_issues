# Github Issue Viewer

This project is a simple 2-part app that requests the issues list from a project, and presents them in a form.

The user should be able to give the name of the project. The default will start with `Ockam` and the user can submit a different project to see the issues.

This project can be deployed locally, but will also be pushed to `Fly.io`.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4444`](http://localhost:4444) from your browser.
